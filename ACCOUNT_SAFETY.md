 GitHub Account Safety & Suspension Prevention
==================================================

Purpose:
--------
This guide is for users running this project on GitHub Actions. 
It explains why accounts can be suspended and how to prevent it while streaming to Telegram.

Common Reasons for Suspension:
------------------------------
1. Suspicious Login Activity
   - Unusual logins from different locations or devices.
   - Solution: Enable 2FA and keep credentials safe.

2. Lack of Development Activity
   - Accounts that don’t show meaningful code/development activity may be flagged.
   - Solution: Keep repos active with code, commits, and collaboration.

3. Multiple Accounts
   - GitHub allows one personal account per person (plus a machine account if needed).
   - Solution: Avoid creating multiple free accounts.

4. Automatic Anti-Abuse Flags
   - New accounts or unusual activity may trigger false positives.
   - Solution: Maintain a normal usage pattern and avoid spammy behavior.

5. Violation of Terms of Service
   - Using GitHub Actions for prohibited activities or excessive streaming that violates fair use.
   - Solution: Only use this project for **educational, personal, or experimental streaming**.

Prevention Tips:
----------------
- Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).  
- Use your GitHub account for genuine development work.  
- Keep your **Telegram Bot token and chat IDs** private; never share them publicly.  
- Only run allowed activities; avoid illegal, abusive, or spammy behavior.  
- Respect the free-tier usage limits of GitHub Actions.

If Your Account Gets Suspended:
-------------------------------
1. Go to https://support.github.com/contact  
2. Select "Account Suspension Appeal".  
3. Provide:
   - Your GitHub username.  
   - A clear explanation of your intended usage (educational/personal streaming).  
   - Any proof that your usage was within GitHub’s Terms of Service.  
4. Wait for GitHub’s reply (may take 24–72 hours).
