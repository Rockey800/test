 GitHub Account Safety & Suspension Prevention
==================================================

Purpose:
--------
This guide is for users running this project on GitHub Actions. 
It explains why accounts can be suspended and how to prevent it.

Common Reasons for Suspension:
------------------------------
1. Suspicious Login Activity
   - Unusual logins from different locations or devices.
   - Solution: Enable 2FA and keep credentials safe.

2. Lack of Development Activity
   - Accounts that don’t show meaningful code/development activity may be flagged.
   - Solution: Keep repos active with code, commits, and collaboration.

3. Multiple Accounts
   - GitHub allows one personal account per person (plus a machine account if needed).
   - Solution: Avoid creating multiple free accounts.

4. Automatic Anti-Abuse Flags
   - New accounts or unusual activity may trigger false positives.
   - Solution: Maintain a normal usage pattern and avoid spammy behavior.

5. Violation of Terms of Service
   - Using GitHub Actions for mining, illegal activity, or prohibited uses.
   - Solution: Only use the project for educational and personal testing.

Prevention Tips:
----------------
- Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
- Use your GitHub account for genuine development work.
- Keep your ngrok token private and never share it in public repos.
- Only run allowed activities; avoid anything illegal or malicious.
- Respect the free-tier usage limits of GitHub Actions and ngrok.

If Your Account Gets Suspended:
-------------------------------
1. Go to https://support.github.com/contact
2. Select "Account Suspension Appeal".
3. Provide:
   - Your GitHub username.
   - A clear explanation of your intended usage (educational/testing).
   - Any proof that your usage was within GitHub’s Terms of Service.
4. Wait for GitHub’s reply (may take 24–72 hours).
