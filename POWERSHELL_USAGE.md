# PowerShell Usage & Security Guidelines

This repository uses **PowerShell scripts exclusively** for automation tasks including setting up Windows RDP, managing ngrok tunnels, and data transfers.

## Best Practices and Guidelines

1. **Script Execution Policy**  
   - PowerShell scripts are designed to run with appropriate execution policies.  
   - Avoid using unrestricted policies on systems you do not fully control.

2. **Handling Secrets Securely**  
   - Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive tokens (e.g., ngrok auth token, Dropbox API keys).  
   - Never hardcode secrets inside scripts or commit them to the repo.  
   - Avoid printing secrets in logs; use PowerShell’s secure string and masking features where possible.

3. **Ngrok Usage**  
   - Use ngrok responsibly to expose tunnels temporarily.  
   - Do not use tunnels for unauthorized access or bypassing network security policies.  
   - Keep your ngrok tokens private and secure.

4. **Script Safety and Auditing**  
   - Regularly audit PowerShell scripts for security and efficiency.  
   - Avoid running scripts that perform untrusted operations or download unverified content.

5. **Compliance and Ethics**  
   - Scripts should be used only for legitimate purposes (e.g., data downloading, authorized remote access).  
   - Do not use these scripts for malicious, illegal, or abusive activities.

6. **Logging and Debugging**  
   - Implement logging to troubleshoot but avoid logging sensitive information.  
   - Use PowerShell’s built-in error handling to gracefully manage failures.
