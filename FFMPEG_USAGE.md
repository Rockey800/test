# FFmpeg Usage & Security Guidelines

This repository uses **FFmpeg commands and GitHub Actions workflows** for streaming live video to Telegram channels or groups.

## Best Practices and Guidelines

1. **Command Execution and Environment**  
   - Run FFmpeg commands in controlled environments (GitHub Actions, VPS, or personal server).  
   - Avoid executing scripts or commands on systems you do not fully control.  

2. **Handling Secrets Securely**  
   - Store sensitive data (Telegram Bot token, chat IDs, API keys) in **GitHub Secrets**.  
   - Never hardcode secrets in scripts, workflow files, or logs.  
   - Avoid printing secrets in console output; use secure variables where possible.  

3. **Streaming Best Practices**  
   - Only stream content you have rights to broadcast.  
   - Use proper network buffering, reconnect options, and bitrate settings to ensure stable streams.  
   - Test streams in a safe environment before public broadcasting.  

4. **Workflow Safety and Auditing**  
   - Regularly review FFmpeg commands and workflow files for correctness and efficiency.  
   - Avoid using untrusted URLs or media files that could compromise the environment.  

5. **Compliance and Ethics**  
   - Workflows should be used only for **educational, experimental, or personal streaming**.  
   - Do not use this setup for malicious, illegal, or abusive activities.  

6. **Logging and Debugging**  
   - Enable logging to monitor stream performance but avoid logging sensitive information like bot tokens.  
   - Use workflow error handling and FFmpeg error options to manage failures gracefully.
