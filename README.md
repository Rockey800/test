## Overview

This repository provides scripts and instructions for streaming live video to **Telegram channels or groups** using **FFmpeg**, replacing the previous Ngrok RDP setup.  
It allows high-quality live streaming from any compatible Windows or Linux environment while giving full control over network buffering, reconnect behavior, resolution, and bitrate.

---

## Features

- Stream live video directly to Telegram using FFmpeg  
- Supports HLS, TS, or MP4 input streams  
- Configurable network buffering and reconnect options  
- Compatible with GitHub-hosted runners or personal servers  
- Manual workflow trigger for controlled execution  

---

## Usage

1. Prepare your **video source** (URL, local file, or stream).  
2. Obtain your **Telegram Bot token** and **chat ID**.  
3. Run FFmpeg with a command similar to:

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i <input_source> -c:v copy -c:a copy -f mpegts "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/sendVideo?chat_id=<CHAT_ID>&stream=true"
