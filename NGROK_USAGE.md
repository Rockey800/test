# Ngrok Usage and Integration with GitHub Actions

## What is Ngrok?

Ngrok is a tool that creates secure tunnels from a public endpoint to a locally running network service. This allows you to expose your local server or service (such as Windows RDP) to the internet securely.

## Using Ngrok in GitHub Actions

- Ngrok can be used within GitHub Actions workflows to expose services running on GitHub-hosted runners, such as remote desktop sessions.
- It requires an **authentication token** (Ngrok Authtoken) that you must keep secure. Use GitHub Secrets to store this token and avoid exposing it in logs or code.
- The free tier of Ngrok allows limited simultaneous tunnels and bandwidth, which is suitable for personal and educational use.
- Be mindful of Ngrok's [Terms of Service](https://ngrok.com/tos) and ensure your usage complies with both Ngrok and GitHub policies.

## Best Practices

- Always use your personal Ngrok Auth Token, stored securely in GitHub Secrets.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs or workflow files.
- Limit the duration of your workflow runs to prevent excessive resource consumption.
- Monitor your Ngrok usage regularly via the Ngrok dashboard.
