# Resource Usage and Credits

## GitHub-Hosted Runners

This project runs on GitHub-hosted runners, specifically the **windows-latest** or **ubuntu-latest** environments, which provide:

- 16 GB RAM  
- 4 CPU cores  

These runners are provided free of cost by GitHub to support open-source, educational, and personal projects. We respect GitHub’s [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and use these resources responsibly within their intended limits.

## FFmpeg and Telegram Streaming

This project uses **FFmpeg** to process video and stream it directly to **Telegram channels or groups** via a Telegram Bot.

- Streams are managed through GitHub Actions workflows or personal servers.  
- Bot tokens and chat IDs are stored securely via **GitHub Secrets**.  
- Streaming is intended for personal, educational, and experimental use only.  
- Users must comply with Telegram’s [Terms of Service](https://telegram.org/tos) and FFmpeg licensing guidelines.
