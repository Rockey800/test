## Security Best Practices for Users
Because this project enables **Telegram Live streaming using FFmpeg**:

- **Use your own Telegram Bot token** — never share it publicly.  
- Keep **chat IDs** and other credentials secure.  
- Avoid sending sensitive or private content through the stream.  
- Only stream content you have rights to broadcast.  
- Limit streaming duration to avoid abuse or hitting platform limits.  
- Do not install or use unsafe scripts or software with this setup.  
- Test streams in a controlled environment before sharing publicly.
