# Telegram Live Streaming Integration with GitHub Actions

## What is Telegram Live Streaming?

Telegram Live Streaming allows you to broadcast video content directly to Telegram channels or groups using a Telegram Bot and streaming tools like FFmpeg. This enables high-quality live streaming from any compatible environment while retaining control over resolution, network buffering, and reconnect behavior.

## Using Telegram and FFmpeg in GitHub Actions

- Workflows can use **FFmpeg** to stream video content to Telegram channels or groups through a Telegram Bot.  
- You need a **Telegram Bot token** and **chat ID** to authenticate and send streams. Store these securely using **GitHub Secrets**.  
- This setup works on **GitHub-hosted runners** or personal servers for educational, experimental, or personal use.  
- Ensure compliance with **Telegramâ€™s Terms of Service** and GitHub policies when streaming content.

## Best Practices

- Always use your personal **Telegram Bot token** stored securely in GitHub Secrets.  
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs or workflow files.  
- Limit the duration of your workflow runs to prevent abuse of GitHub-hosted runners.  
- Test streams in a safe environment before broadcasting publicly.  
- Only stream content you are authorized to share.
